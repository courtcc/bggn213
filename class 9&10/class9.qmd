## Importing candy data

```{r}
candy_file <- read.csv("candy-data.txt", row.names=1)

head(candy_file)
```

>Q how many chocolate candy types are in the data set?

37 of the candies are chocolate
```{r}
length(grep('1', candy_file$chocolate))
```

>Q how many fruity candy types are in the data set?

38 of the candies are fruity
```{r}
length(grep('1', candy_file$fruity))
```

>Q how many total candy?

85 different types of candies

```{r}
nrow(candy_file)
```

>Q how many variables/dimesnsions are there

there are 12 different variables/candy types

```{r}
ncol(candy_file)
```

## Data exploration using the package skimr

calling only one function from a package
```{r}
#library(skimr)

skimr::skim(candy_file)
```


## What is your favorite candy

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?


```{r}
candy_file['Baby Ruth',]$winpercent

```

>Q What are the 5 least liked candies

```{r}
inds <- order(candy_file$winpercent)

head(candy_file[inds,])
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy_file['Kit Kat',]$winpercent
```

>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy_file['Tootsie Roll Snack Bars',]$winpercent
```

>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The winpercent column of the data set is on a diffenet scale than the rest of the data set

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

The zero means that the candy was not chosen and the 1 represents that the candy was chosen based on the randomly generated candy matchups



>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy_file, aes(winpercent)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 8)

```


>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

the distribution is not symetrical, it is left skewed
>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

the center of the distribution is belwo 50%
>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

-find all chocolate cady (subset)
-get the winpercent values
-summarice these values into on metric (mean)

```{r}
choc <- subset(candy_file$winpercent, candy_file$chocolate==1)
mean(choc)       

```


```{r}
fruity <- subset(candy_file$winpercent, candy_file$fruity==1)
mean(fruity)
```

```{r}
t.test(choc,fruity)
```

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

the differnece is statistacally significant with a p-value of 2.87e-08


## Overall Candy Rankings

>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy_file$winpercent)

head(candy_file[inds,])
```

>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
```{r}
inds <- order(candy_file$winpercent)

tail(candy_file[inds,])
```

>Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy_file, aes(winpercent, rownames(candy_file))) +
  geom_col()
```

>Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

creating color vector to color the graph based on the type of candies
```{r}
my_cols=rep('darkgrey', nrow(candy_file))
my_cols[as.logical(candy_file$chocolate)] = "chocolate4"
my_cols[as.logical(candy_file$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy_file$fruity)] = "pink3"
```

plot was saved because the aspect ratio was bad for readability
```{r}
ggplot(candy_file, aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy_file),winpercent))) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) +
  labs(x='Matchup Win Percent', y=NULL)
  
ggsave('barplot.png', height=10, width=7)
```


how to insert any image
caption text can go in the square brackets
adding a {} bracket with #fig, a hyperlink will be added with a link to the graph

![win percentage](barplot.png){#fig-gray}



>Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

>Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Nik L Nip


## Taking a look at pricepoint

```{r}
ggplot(candy_file, aes(x=winpercent, y=pricepercent, label=rownames(candy_file)))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text(col=my_cols)
```


ggrepel package can be used to make point lables look nicer, geom_text will put in the labels but doesn't account for overlap
```{r}
library(ggrepel)
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy_file, aes(x=winpercent, y=pricepercent, label=rownames(candy_file)))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 8)
```

>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's miniatures


>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

The least popular is the Nik L Nip

```{r}
inds2 <- order(candy_file$pricepercent, decreasing=TRUE)

head(candy_file[inds2,c(11,12)], n=5)
```

>Q21. Make a barplot again with geom_col() this time using pricepercent and then improve this step by step, first ordering the x-axis by value and finally making a so called “dot chat” or “lollipop” chart by swapping geom_col() for geom_point() + geom_segment().

```{r}
ggplot(candy_file) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy_file), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy_file), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_point()

ggsave('barplot2.png', height = 10,width = 7)
```
Because aspect ratio makes seeing the graph dificult, the plot is loaded in as an image

![](barplot2.png)


## Exploring Correlation

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy_file)
```


```{r}
head(cij)
```

```{r}
corrplot(cij)
```



>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are negatively correlated

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

chocolate highly correlates with bar and winpercent

## PCA

PCA needs to be scaled - scale=TRUE

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy_file, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```
```{r}
pca_result <- as.data.frame(pca$x)
```



```{r}
ggplot(pca_result, aes(x=PC1,y=PC2,label=rownames(pca_result)))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols)+
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7, size=3)

```

Loadings plot

```{r}
pca.loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca.loadings, aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca.loadings),PC1)))+
  geom_col()
```

>Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

The positive direction mostly picked up the fruity, pluribus, and hard candies. This makes sense because these three characteristics are commonly found together within fruity flavored candies
