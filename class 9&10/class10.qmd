# what is in the PDB?

dowload a csv with current commposition data

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv('pdbsummaru.csv', row.names=1)
```

```{r}
head(pdbstats)
```
testing method
```{r}
x <- '2,222'
as.numeric(gsub(',','', x))
```

creating into a function to remove comma, convert to numeric and sum the values
```{r}
sumnum <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(',','', x)))
}
```


```{r}
sumnum(pdbstats$X.ray)
sumnum(pdbstats$EM)
```

apply the function to the entrie table and divide by total to get the percentages
```{r}
apply(pdbstats,2,sumnum) / sumnum(pdbstats$Total)

```


>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

84.54% is done using x-ray and 8.7% is done using EM

```{r}
apply(pdbstats,1,sumnum) / sum(apply(pdbstats,1,sumnum))
```


>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

86% is protien only

>Q3: How does the total number of protein structires in the PDB relate to the total number of protein sequences in UniProt?

the PDB database only accounts of 0.0746% of the data avaliable in Uniprot 

```{r}
186898/250322721 *100
```

# Using Mol*

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?



>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

25

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document

# working with structures in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <-read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```



>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 




>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```
Normal mode analysis (nma) - predicts functional motions and large-scale stucture changes
```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
```

make a movie (a.k.a trajectory) of the predicted motion
```{r}
mktrj(m, file='adk_movie.pdb')
```


# Quick comparitice analysis of structures

extract sequence and runa BLAST search
```{r}
s <- pdbseq(adk)
blast <- blast.pdb(s)

plot(blast)
```

Get the ruslts from BLAST and download all the top hits
```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```
accession numbers of all the significant blasts to the database
```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```
download all the blast result pdb files
```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

Align and superimpose the structures
```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

# PCA of all the adk structures

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
mktrj(pc.xray, file='pca_movie.pdb')
```
