```{r}
ge <- read.table('BI1.txt')
```

```{r}
table(ge$geno)
```
```{r}
AA<- subset(ge, geno=='A/A')
AG<- subset(ge, geno=='A/G')
GG<- subset(ge, geno=='G/G')
```

```{r}

>Q13. Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes

A|A=108   median exp: 31.24847
A|G=233   median exp: 25.06486
G|G=121   median exp: 20.07363

>Q14.Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

expression level of G/G is lower thn A/A meaning that the SNP does impact expression levels


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(ge, aes(geno,exp, fill=geno))+
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```
